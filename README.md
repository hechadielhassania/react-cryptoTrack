## Why TypeScript?
CryptoTrack is built using TypeScript for several reasons:
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides static typing, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Code Maintainability**: With TypeScript, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand, making it simpler to maintain and update.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: TypeScript offers better tooling support in modern IDEs, including code completion, refactoring, and debugging features.
